FUNCTIONS OF BLOOD   
[ I ]  TRANSPORT    
          (a)  Gases  
          (b) Nutrients  
          (c ) Waste and toxic materials  
          (d) Hormones   
      [iii] Body temperature  by the specific properties of water :-  
                                    a)  High specific heat of  water helps absorb heat from 
                                            inner parts and bring heat to surface .  
                                    b)  High  latent heat of evaporation  helps sweat evaporate 
                                            and carry heat away from surface. 
[ II ]   MAINTENANCE  
[i] Water balance   between cells and plasma by maintaining osmotic 
                                pressure  with help of Na ⁺ and plasma proteins. 
 [ii] Acid-base balance  by buffers in blood like :-  
                                                  H₂CO₃ ↔  HCO₃⁻⁻  system 
                                                   Phosphate buffer system 
                                                   Oxy  ↔  reduced hemoglobin buffers. 
[ III ]  STORES  of   Glucose,  aminoacids,  electrolytes,  water,  etc  
[ IV ] DEFENCE    by properties of Leucocytes ( WBC), immune system  
             & complement proteins  found in blood the body is protected  
             against microorganisms  & foreign matter.  
[ V ] PREVENTION OF BLOOD LOSS   by  forming a clot. 
                                  by the clotting factors  and  thrombocytes
